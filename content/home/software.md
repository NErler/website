## R Shiny application
### Testing fo the need of nonlinear effects
[[link](https://emcbiostatistics.shinyapps.io/NonlinearEffects/)]

Online tool to test for non-linear effects in standard regression models 
(linear, logistic, poisson and Cox regression) using natural cubic splines.
The non-linear fit is presented in a graph and the test results are given 
together with the resulting conclusion.
