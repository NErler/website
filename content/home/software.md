## R package
###  **JointAI**: Joint Analysis and Imputation of Incomplete Data
[[GitHub](https://github.com/NErler/JointAI)] 
[[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=JointAI)]
[[website](https://NErler.github.io/JointAI/)]

Provides joint analysis and imputation of linear regression models,
generalized linear regression models or linear mixed models with incomplete
(covariate) data in the Bayesian framework.

## R Shiny application
### Testing fo the need of nonlinear effects
[[link](https://emcbiostatistics.shinyapps.io/NonlinearEffects/)]

Online tool to test for non-linear effects in standard regression models 
(linear, logistic, poisson and Cox regression) using natural cubic splines.
The non-linear fit is presented in a graph and the test results are given 
together with the resulting conclusion.
