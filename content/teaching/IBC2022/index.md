Together with Prof. Emmanuel Lesaffre (KU Leuven), I teach a short course on Bayesian 
**Methods for Missing Covariates in Longitudinal Studies**.

The materials for the edition we gave at the conference of the [International
Biometric Society](https://www.biometricsociety.org/home) can be found on the
[course website <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt fa-xs"></i>](https://nerler.github.io/IBC2022_BayesianMissingData/).
