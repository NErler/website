Together with Prof. Geert Molenberghs, I teach [EP16: Missing Data in Clinical Research](https://www.nihes.com/course/ep16_missing_values_in_clinical_research)
at the [Netherlands Institute of Health Sciences (NIHES)](https://www.nihes.com/)

Materials for the part on multiple imputation can be found on 
[GitHub](https://github.com/NErler/EP16_Multiple_Imputation) and the associated
