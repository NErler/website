I am a PhD student at the Department of Biostatistics at the Erasmus Medical
Center in Rotterdam. My research focus is on Bayesian methods for incomplete
data, specifically for settings with missing covariates.
Since 2017, I support the department of Gastroenterology & Hepatology
in the planning and analysis of clinical trials and 
observational studies.
