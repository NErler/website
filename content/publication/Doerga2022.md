abstract: "#### Background\n
Children with Crouzon syndrome have a higher incidence of cerebellar tonsillar
herniation (TH) and ventriculomegaly than the general population, or children
with other craniosynostosis syndromes.

#### Objective\n
This retrospective cohort study aimed to determine how ventriculomegaly and TH
develop and progress over time, and determine associations between
ventriculomegaly and TH in Crouzon patients, treated according to our center’s
protocol.

#### Methods\n
Fronto-occipital horn ratio (FOHR) and TH were determined over time using
brain-imaging. These data were used to fit a mixed-model to determine
associations between them, and with clinical variables, head-circumference, and
lambdoid suture synostosis.

#### Results:\n
Sixty-three Crouzon patients were included in this study. Preoperatively, 28%
had ventriculomegaly, and 11% had TH ≥ +5 mm. Postoperatively ventriculomegaly
increased to 49%. Over time and with treatment, FOHR declined and stabilized
around 5 years of age. TH ≥ +5 mm increased to 46% during follow-up. FOHR and TH
were associated: expected FOHR with a TH of either 0 mm versus +8.6 mm at 0
years: 0.44 versus 0.49, and at 5 years: 0.34 versus 0.38; 10% increase of FOHR
was associated with 1.6 mm increase in TH. Increased head-circumference was
associated with increased FOHR. Lambdoid suture synostosis was associated with
+6.9 mm TH increase.

#### Conclusions:\n
In Crouzon patients, FOHR was large at onset and decreased and stabilized with
treatment and time. FOHR was associated with head-circumference and TH. TH was
strongly associated with lambdoid suture synostosis and FOHR. Increased
head-circumference was associated with an increased FOHR, and closed lambdoid
sutures before 1 year of age were associated with a +6.92 mm increase in tonsil
position."
