abstract: "Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a common indication for liver
transplantation (LT). Up to 25% of patients experience recurrence of PSC (rPSC)
after LT, which is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. To date,
it is not possible to predict which patients are at risk for rPSC. The aetiology
of PSC is complex and is speculated to involve translocation of intestinal
bacteria to the liver, because of its frequent co‐occurrence with inflammatory
bowel diseases (IBD). Here, we investigate whether the mucosal intestinal
microbiome of PSC patients (n = 97) at time of first LT can identify those
patients who will develop rPSC. 16S gene sequencing of bacterial DNA isolated
from formalin‐fixed paraffin‐embedded biopsies showed that PSC patients with
Crohn’s disease (n = 15) have a reduced microbial diversity and that
inflammation of the mucosa is associated with beta‐diversity changes and feature
differences. No differences in alpha‐ or beta diversity were observed between
patients with rPSC (n = 14) and without rPSC (n = 83). However, many
over‐represented bacterial features were detected in patients with rPSC, while
surprisingly, those without recurrence of disease were characterized by an
increased presence of the Gammaproteobacteria Shigella. This pilot study
warrants further investigation into bacterial differences between rPSC and
non‐rPSC patients."
