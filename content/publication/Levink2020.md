abstract: "#### Background & Aims\n
Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is the most common treatment for flat Barrett’s
esophagus (BE), but reasons for varying outcomes are poorly understood. A
recently developed contrast-enhancement algorithm allows reliable measurement of
Barrett’s epithelial thickness (BET) from volumetric laser endomicroscopy (VLE)
images and correlation with response to RFA. Using this algorithm, we
investigated whether patients with thicker Barrett’s mucosa are less likely to
respond to RFA. In the future, this algorithm may guide choice of RFA dosing or
endoscopic resection.

#### Methods\n
We performed a retrospective analysis on all patients with BE who received a
baseline VLE scan between May 2015 and October 2016, followed by RFA and 1
follow-up exam, from 14 institutions participating in the United States VLE
registry. We measured BET on equidistant locations by estimating the distance
between the esophageal surface and the superficial edge of the deepest lamina
propria. The primary outcome variable was the percentage reduction in Prague
length; secondary outcome variables were complete remission of intestinal
metaplasia (CRIM) and presence of strictures after 12 months.

#### Results:\n 
Images from 61 patients were included in our final analysis. Mean BET per
patient ranged from 224 μm to 705 μm. A 100 μm thicker mean BET per patient
resulted in a 12% lower response to treatment, measured by a reduction of Prague
length ( P = .03), after adjustment for confounders. We found an association
between mean BET and CRIM, but not with stricture formation.

#### Conclusions:\n
Based on measurements on contrast-enhanced VLE images, we found that BET
correlates with response to RFA. For clinical implementation, larger studies
with a standardized follow-up and development of computer-aided image analysis
systems are needed."
