abstract: "#### Background\n
Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided tissue acquisition is extensively used, but
the optimal sampling device is still a matter of debate. We performed
meta-analyses on studies comparing fine-needle aspiration (FNA) with fine-needle
biopsy (FNB) needles, and studies comparing different FNB needles.

#### Methods\n
Online databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of at
least 50 cases with a suspected solid pancreatic or nonpancreatic lesion that
compared FNA with FNB needles. Outcome measures included diagnostic accuracy,
adequacy, number of passes, presence of tissue cores, and adverse events. We
also performed meta-regression analysis on the effect of FNB design on
diagnostic accuracy. Quality was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool.

#### Results:\n
18 RCTs comparing FNA with FNB needles were included. FNB provided a higher
pooled diagnostic accuracy (87% vs. 80%; P=0.02) and tissue core rate (80% vs.
62%; P=0.002), and allowed diagnosis with fewer passes (P=0.03), in both
pancreatic and non-pancreatic lesions. A total of 93 studies were included
comparing different FNB devices. Pooled diagnostic accuracy was higher for
forward-facing bevel needles than for the reverse bevel needle. In this
analysis, study quality was low and heterogeneity was high (*I<sup>2</sup>*=80%).


#### Conclusions:\n
FNB outperformed FNA when sampling pancreatic and non-pancreatic lesions.
Forward-facing bevel FNB needles seemed to outperform the reverse bevel FNB
needle, but the low quality of evidence prevents us from making strong
recommendations on the optimal FNB design."
