abstract: "#### Background & Aims\n
Predictors of successful nucleo(s)tide analogue (NA) therapy withdrawal remain
elusive. We studied the relationship between end-of-treatment levels of
hepatitis B core-related antigen (HBcrAg) and hepatitis B surface antigen
(HBsAg) and outcome after therapy cessation.

#### Methods\n
Patients who discontinued NA therapy in centers in Asia and Europe were
enrolled. HBcrAg and HBsAg were measured at treatment cessation, and
associations with off-treatment outcomes were explored. The SCALE-B score was
calculated as previously reported. End points included sustained virologic
response (VR; hepatitis B virus DNA level <2000 IU/mL), HBsAg loss, and alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) flares (>3× upper limit of normal). Re-treated patients
were considered nonresponders.

#### Results:\n
We analyzed 572 patients, 457 (80%) were Asian and 95 (17%) were hepatitis B e
antigen positive at the start of NA therapy. The median treatment duration was
295 weeks. VR was observed in 267 (47%), HBsAg loss was observed in 24 (4.2%),
and ALT flare was observed in 92 (16%). VR (67% vs 42%) and HBsAg loss (15% vs
1.5%) was observed more frequently in non-Asian patients (P < .001). Lower
HBcrAg levels were associated with higher rates of VR (odds ratio [OR], 0.701; P
< .001) and HBsAg loss (OR, 0.476; P < .001), and lower rates of ALT flares (OR,
1.288; P = .005). Similar results were observed with HBsAg (VR: OR, 0.812; P =
.011; HBsAg loss: OR, 0.380; P < .001; and ALT flare: OR, 1.833; P < .001).
Lower SCALE-B scores were associated with higher rates of VR, HBsAg loss, and
lower rates of ALT flares in both Asian and non-Asian patients (P < .001).

#### Conclusions:\n
In this multicenter study, off-treatment outcomes after NA cessation varied with
ethnicity. Lower levels of HBcrAg and HBsAg were associated with favorable
outcomes. A risk score comprising both factors can be used for risk
stratification."
