abstract: "#### Background\n
It remains unclear whether urgent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
(ERCP) with biliary sphincterotomy improves the outcome of patients with
gallstone pancreatitis without concomitant cholangitis. We did a randomised
trial to compare urgent ERCP with sphincterotomy versus conservative treatment
in patients with predicted severe acute gallstone pancreatitis.

#### Methods\n
In this multicentre, parallel-group, assessor-masked, randomised controlled
superiority trial, patients with predicted severe (Acute Physiology and Chronic
Health Evaluation II score ≥8, Imrie score ≥3, or C-reactive protein
concentration >150 mg/L) gallstone pancreatitis without cholangitis were
assessed for eligibility in 26 hospitals in the Netherlands. Patients were
randomly assigned (1:1) by a web-based randomisation module with randomly
varying block sizes to urgent ERCP with sphincterotomy (within 24 h after
hospital presentation) or conservative treatment. The primary endpoint was a
composite of mortality or major complications (new-onset persistent organ
failure, cholangitis, bacteraemia, pneumonia, pancreatic necrosis, or pancreatic
insufficiency) within 6 months of randomisation. Analysis was by intention to
treat. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN97372133.

#### Findings:\n
Between Feb 28, 2013, and March 1, 2017, 232 patients were randomly assigned to
urgent ERCP with sphincterotomy (n=118) or conservative treatment (n=114). One
patient from each group was excluded from the final analysis because of
cholangitis (urgent ERCP group) and chronic pancreatitis (conservative treatment
group) at admission. The primary endpoint occurred in 45 (38%) of 117 patients
in the urgent ERCP group and in 50 (44%) of 113 patients in the conservative
treatment group (risk ratio [RR] 0·87, 95% CI 0·64–1·18; p=0·37). No relevant
differences in the individual components of the primary endpoint were recorded
between groups, apart from the occurrence of cholangitis (two [2%] of 117 in the
urgent ERCP group vs 11 [10%] of 113 in the conservative treatment group; RR
0·18, 95% CI 0·04–0·78; p=0·010). Adverse events were reported in 87 (74%) of
118 patients in the urgent ERCP group versus 91 (80%) of 114 patients in the
conservative treatment group.


#### Interpretation:\n
In patients with predicted severe gallstone pancreatitis but without
cholangitis, urgent ERCP with sphincterotomy did not reduce the composite
endpoint of major complications or mortality, compared with conservative
treatment. Our findings support a conservative strategy in patients with
predicted severe acute gallstone pancreatitis with an ERCP indicated only in
patients with cholangitis or persistent cholestasis.
